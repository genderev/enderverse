<h1>Do I want to wear makeup?</h1>

<center> Do I want to keep wearing makeup? What would that look like? </center>

<h2> Wearing makeup in public </h2>

<p> I stopped wearing makeup daily because of the pandemic. Looking back, I realize that when I wore makeup in public, I was always thinking about how others perceived my appearance.  </p>

<p> I like makeup as a tool for expressing yourself - but I would be lying if I said makeup is always, or even usually, used to express oneself. </p>


<h2> Wearing makeup in my room </h2>

<p> During the first year of the pandemic (2020) I was reluctant to give up makeup. Putting on makeup - the physical act of painting myself - always makes me feel better.  <br><br>

I found that actually wearing makeup was a different experience than putting it on. As soon as I walked out of my room I couldn't stop thinking: what do others think of me? </p>

<h2> Engaging with makeup </h2>

<p> I have been watching makeup tutorials and collecting makeup looks I want to try for years. </p>

<p> There are multiple ways for me to engage with makeup, though: </p>
<ol>
<li> Looking at other people with makeup
<li> Designing a makeup look for myself inspired by the work of others
<li> Walking around in that makeup
</ol>

I like looking at makeup and designing makeup looks for myself, but I'm not sure how I feel about walking around in makeup anymore.

<h2> Passively enjoying makeup, without wearing it </h2>

<p> I always like when people describe makeup application as the act of painting your face. <br><br>I feel at peace when makeup application feels like art creation - looking at myself in the mirror and drawing on myself. </p>
<p> What if I explore only the painting aspect of makeup application, without involving my face in the process? </p>

<h2> Makeup paintings </h2>

I made these paintings using <a href="neuralselfie.html"> neural style transfer</a>.

<div class="half">
<figure class='left-half'><img src='../assets/makeup-out.png' alt="Image of makeup"></figure> <figure class='right-half'><img src='../assets/makeup1-out.png' alt="Image of makeup"></figure>
</div>

<p> I still think about the ethical implications of neural style transfer sometimes - mostly the issue of attribution and credit. </p>
