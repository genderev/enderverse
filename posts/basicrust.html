<h2> notes on basic rust </h2>

<p> I actually talked to one of the authors of the official Rust book and he was pretty nice.
  That being said, I found the book hard to get through. If I knew anyone trying to learn Rust, I would recommend Easy Rust to them instead. </p>


<p> I've seen a lot of articles or posts like the one I'm about to begin - code snippets of Rust with notes in the comments.
  What I didn't understand before is that you don't learn Rust by reading someone else's notes, but by writing your own.

<p> Until now, I didn't understand how to put variables in the middle of a string. This frustrated me so much when I was working on <a href="https://mindgarden.fun/">Mind Garden</a>. </p>

<p>

In C, you need to manually allocate memory on the heap with <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>. If you forget to call <code>free</code> on memory you previously allocated with <code>malloc</code>, you get a memory leak and the memory will remain allocated until the program stops running. Memory leaks are easy to cause in C and pretty difficult to stumble upon in Rust.
