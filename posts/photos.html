<h1> On [still/moving] photos </h1>
<h2> Photos as education </h2>

- karl rove's mentor taught him subliminal messaging/marketing tricks to use with george bush like
    - flashing "RAT" before showing the face of a political opponent too fast to be registered by the viewer (this was not rove, but the ad producer was mentored by "dirty tricks" lee atwater)
    - playing music to alter viewer's perception of a video
    - displaying main topic of a video in plain wording behind bush as he discussed that topic
- Duhamel - “I can no longer think what I want to think. My thoughts have been replaced by moving images.”
- paintings invite the spectator to contemplate - movies prevent the spectator from thinking (constant changing images)
<h2> Photos for consumption </h2>
- making many reproductions substitutes a plurality of copies for a unique existence
- “Quantity has been transmuted into quality.”
- photography expresses the American impatience with reality
        - “the hundredth of a second caught so precisely that the motion is continued from the picture indefinitely”
        - “Speed is at the bottom of it all.”
- photography converts the world into a museum-without-walls in which every subject is an article to be consumed
    - through the camera, people become customers of reality
-  the final reason for the need to photograph is consumption itself
    - to consume means to burn, to use up - and so to need to be replenished
    - as we make images and consume them, we need more

<h2> Being photographed -> being consumed </h2>
- there is something predatory in the act of taking a picture
    - to photograph people turns them into objects that can be symbolically possessed
        - through being photographed, the subject becomes part of a system of information, fitted into schemes of classification and storage
- for screen actors:
    - “The audience’s identification with the actor is really an identification with the camera. “
        - unlike with stage actors, the screen actor does not actually interact with the audience
        - the audience is interacting with the camera
- “The feeling of strangeness that overcomes the actor before the camera, as Pirandello describes it, is basically of the same kind as the estrangement felt before one’s own image in the mirror. But now the reflected image has become separable, transportable. And where is it transported? Before the public.”
    - “This market, where he offers not only his labor but also his whole self,”
