<h1 id="what-s-the-danger-of-open-source-">Why I no longer use the MIT license</h1>

<p>What if your open source code is used for something evil? <br><br>It happened to Andrew Tanenbaum. </p>

<h2 id="how-did-this-company-use-the-open-source-code-">What happened to Andrew Tanenbaum?</h2>
<p>Andrew Tanenbaum released the third version of the MINIX operating system under the permissive <a href="https://itsfoss.com/fact-intel-minix-case/">Berkeley license</a>.</p>
<p>When employees from Intel started asking Tanenbaum technical questions about the MINIX 3 operating system, he was happy to <a href="https://itsfoss.com/fact-intel-minix-case/">engage them</a>. Eventually, Intel secretly modified the MINIX 3 operating system for use in Intel CPUs.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-wrong-with-this-company-using-open-source-code-">What’s wrong with Intel using open source code?</h2>

<p>On the fifth of May in 2017, Intel released a patch for the Intel CPUs running <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/the-hijacking-flaw-that-lurked-in-intel-chips-is-worse-than-anyone-thought/">MINIX 3</a>. Before this security patch, it was possible for hackers to remotely access computers that had an Intel CPU running MINIX 3 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/the-hijacking-flaw-that-lurked-in-intel-chips-is-worse-than-anyone-thought/">without a password</a>.</p>

<h2 id="did-this-company-fix-their-security-problems-">Did Intel fix their security problems?</h2>

<p>Although Intel’s CTO Steve Grobman has denied it, Intel’s Management Engine is a <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/is-the-intel-management-engine-a-backdoor/">backdoor by definition</a>. Hackers can bypass normal authentication and access a user’s computer by entering their computer through the ME.</p>
<p>To date, the sheer number of exploits affecting the ME - six to date - can be used to make the argument that the ME was designed to be exploited, that is, that the ME is a backdoor.</p>
<p>The Intel Management Engine’s newest exploit - of which there are many - is SA-00086 . Because the Intel Management Engine is more privileged than the operating system, it is actually not possible for a computer affected by this exploit to fix the issue by downloading an <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/eu-17/briefings/schedule/#how-to-hack-a-turned-off-computer-or-running-unsigned-code-in-intel-management-engine-8668">operating system update</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-the-open-source-code-writer-feel-">How does Andrew Tanenbaum feel?</h2>
<p>Even in 2017, the creator of MINIX had regrets working with Intel on ME, saying he would not have worked with them on ME if he knew they were building a <a href="https://itsfoss.com/fact-intel-minix-case/">“spy engine”</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew Tanenbaum seems to regret his decision working with Intel, but most people who permissively license their code find it rewarding. The question remains: to license permissively or not?</p>
