<h1> Why does community care matter for FFF? </h1>
<center> I personally think community care is the fastest and most effective way to stop global warming. </center>
<h2>The climate emergency </h2>
<p>
  Mayor de Blasio has said that New York City has a climate emergency. While in office,
Mayor de Blasio allowed the destruction of nature in this city despite consistent protests
from locals. Why do politicians claim they care about global warming while making the
situation worse?<br><br>
The wealthiest people in the world cause the most harm to nature. The poorest people
in the world experience the effects of this harm. We can see this happening in real time
at East River Park.<br><br>
East River Park is a park in Manhattan across the street from a public housing complex.
This is a low-lying area where it is easy for flooding to happen.<br><br>
The mayor allowed the city to cut down the trees in this park, which is dangerous
because trees are actually flood protection. Why did Mayor de Blasio let the city cut
down these trees?
</p>
<h2> How politicians feel about FFF </h2>
<p>
The root of the problem is that making a profit is Mayor de Blasioâ€™s idea of happiness.
We need to allow politicians and CEOs to taste the kind of happiness that doesnâ€™t harm the environment.
<br><br>

If money really made up for loss and lovelessness, the wealthy would be the most blissful people on the planet.
Instead, they are isolated and lonely.
Wealthier nations report higher rates of depression than poorer nations because they rely on money instead of emotional support systems during times of stress.
<br><br>
Isolation and loneliness cause depression and despair.
Yet they are the outcome of life in a culture where things matter more than you and I. <br><br>
Whenever things matter more then people, we are asked to sacrifice the vision of freedom, love, and justice for the worship of money. <br><br>
Princeton researchers found that no matter how much support there is for a bill among Americans, public opinion does not affect whether that bill will be passed or not. More support for a bill does not get it passed. <br><br>
Congress will not vote for laws to regulate themselves, like laws that would stop politcial bribery and fix broken elections. Congress just recently voted against an act that would protect the voting rights of people of color. <br><br>
The system we live in, where profit matters more than people to politicians, canâ€™t carry us into the future.
It ends here if we say so. <br><br>
The freedom that FFF is striking for will never be given to them by politicians, because politicians will prioritize profit over people until the end of time.
</p>
<h2> We can stop global warming without passing bills </h2>
<p> We have to create our own freedom.
We must become the systems we need. <br><br>
No government, political party, or corporation is going to stop global warming for us, so we have to learn how to care for each other.
<br><br>
We are creating a world we have never seen by choosing people over profit, because we know that we need to care for each other to survive. <br><br>
We are whispering this to each other cuddled in the dark, and we are screaming it at people who are so scared of it that they dress themselves in war regalia to turn and face us. <br><br>
You may be afraid. You may think that a new world is simply too hard to reach. You may think the systems in place are simply too entrenched and old and complex to change or get rid of.

</p>
<h2> How we can stop global warming </h2>
We often get in the habit of thinking that the changes required to stop global warming
are impossible. <br><br>
Change is inevitable. An economy based on extracting seemingly infinite resources
from a planet with finite natural resources will come to an end.
What the future will be depends on us. The future depends on the choices which we
make now. <br><br>
Once upon a time, peasants around the world thought that they would always be ruled
by kings and queens. Now, kings and queens are rare. We may reach a time in the
future where the politicians and businesspeople who make global warming worse
belong to the past. <br><br>
We are constantly told to be polite and submissive in order to maintain the status quo.
American culture relies on the cultivation of fear as a way to ensure obedience. <br><br> In
our society we make much of love and say little about fear. Yet we are all terribly afraid
most of the time. <br><br>
We are afraid of corrupt government officials. We are afraid of people we love dying. We
are afraid of the pollution of rivers and lakes. <br><br>
As a culture we are obsessed with the notion of safety. Yet we do not question why we
live in states of extreme anxiety and dread. <br><br> Fear is the primary force upholding
American culture.
As we give and receive love, we let go of fear. Fear looks ahead. Love looks to the
present.
<h2> What our future looks like </h2>
Here we are, in this moment. What we touch in the present moment is life
itself. <br><br>
Here you are, in the cycle between the past and the future, choosing to spend your
miraculous time to shape change. <br><br>
Our true home is in the present moment.  To live in the present moment is a miracle. <br><br>
<em>Eco</em> comes from the Greek word <em>oikos</em>, meaning home. An ecosystem is a description
of the relationships in a home. <br><br>
When we come together, we find a home in each other as well as in ourselves. In the
present moment, there exists a communal home for us to share. <br><br>
We each have important pieces of the whole. Everyone is needed. You are needed. <br><br>
Wisdom, or insight, is collective. The human body is an organism with trillions of cells
working together in harmony. <br><br> Every member of the community holds pieces of the
solution.
Here is my contribution to the solution: I am asking you for help. <br><br> I am asking you to let
go of fear and receive love from the people in your community - the people on your
street, on your block. Join a community garden. Add food to a community fridge. Share
resources. <br><br>
When we experience love, we can understand that happiness does not come from
money or profit. When we care for each other, we are caring for nature. <br><br> We are nature.
Our continued existence on this planet relies on our ability to remember our connection
to Earth. We are nature. Not separate or disconnected. <br><br>
We are nature. Nature regenerates. Nature lives on no matter what, in oceans, forests,
volcanoes and shifting tectonic plates. Nature heals itself.
It is our right and responsibility to create a new world. <br><br> Letâ€™s work together, with more
people, from more places. We need to move from competition, where we try to push our
individual ideas, to collective collaboration. <br><br>

Our prophetic imagination is outrageousâ€”not merely in dreaming a dream, but in
already living out the dream before it has come to pass, and in embodying this dream in
concrete action. We can take care of the gardens and parks in our community.  We can create local renewable power.  <br><br>
We can take care of each other. <br><br>

The future we want is one where many worlds fit. We shape tomorrow towards
abundance.
Abundance means that we have time to nurture our souls through songs and ceremony,
through practice and play. <br><br>

Abundance means that no one earns the right to stay alive by getting a job. Abundance
means that every one of us has the right to exist because we were born. <br><br>

Because of our ancestors, and because of us, we can create a future where each living
being is treated as sacred. <br><br>

We can create a future wherein we see our lives and our fate as intimately connected to
that of everyone else on this planet. Yes. A future of abundance. <br><br>

By working together, we can increase our awareness of our place in the miraculous. <br>
