<h2 id='offset'>Why does Thousand Fell buy carbon offsets?</h2>
<p>
The <a href='https://www.thousandfell.com/pages/mission'>Thousand Fell website admits</a> that they buy carbon offsets. <br><br>

Carbon offsets assign a monetary value to greenhouse gas pollution.
This allows fossil fuel extraction to continue under the assumption that the global economic market will somehow force significant emissions reductions. <br><br>
<em> This belief has not come true, </em> so why are carbon offsets used by Thousand Fell? <br><br>

This is <strong>greenwashing</strong>. Carbon offsets can be purchased by polluters to claim the status of "being green" while still causing pollution.
<strong>Pollution persists</strong> in communities disproportionately populated by people of color, and this is called environmental racism.  <br><br>

Researchers from the University of Leeds find that oil refineries are more likely to be in low-income US neighborhoods. <br><br>
Asian, Black, and Latino communities fight asthma because they live near petroleum refineries. Indigneous people struggle aginst the creation of fracking pielines in their communities. <br><br>

</p>

<h2 id='zero'>Is Thousand Fell zero waste?</h2>
<p>
Put frankly, Thousand Fell <em> <strong>is not</strong> </em>zero waste. <br><br> This is greenwashing. <br><br>

Hillary Renick defines zero waste as:
<ul>
<li> reducing, reusing, recycling and composting waste <em> locally,  where we live, right here, right in this place, where we are now</em>
<li> reducing climate pollution by relocalizing the economy
<li> transitiong to <em> local, community-centered </em> economies
</ul>

(Thousand Fell does not do any of that.) <br><br> 
A huge benefit of going zero-waste is eliminating the <em> pollution from transportation</em>.
</p>

<h2 id='goal'>What do we do?</h2>
<p>We try to stop global warming. Thousand Fell makes global warming worse. Let's ignore Thousand Fell. <br><br> We can focus on taking care of people in our community instead.</p>
