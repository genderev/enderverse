<h1> painting taeyong </h1>

<h2> possession in my "art" </h2>
<p> I want to talk about painting - just quoting what I read in <em> Ways Of Seeing </em> from when I had enough free time to read books this summer. </p>

<h3> Reasons fanart exists: </h3>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://enderverse.org/posts/taeyong.html"> beauty creates copies of itself </a> </li>
<li> get attention from other fans </li>
<li> get attention from subject of fanart </li>
<li> gain possession over the subject of the fanart &larr; <strong> our topic for today </strong> </li>
</ul>

<p> I already described how <a href="../posts/photos.html"> photographers exercise power over the people being photographed</a>. Every time you make art using the likeness of someone else, you are only describing your own worldview. A photographic portrait of someone is not objective reality, but merely the photographer's view of the person they photographed. </p>

<p> When I use neural style transfer and <a href="https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1703.08173"> super-resolution convolutional neural networks</a> to generate images that look like Taeyong, I can own some form of Taeyong's being, his likeness. </p>
<p> It is harder to be surrounded by books and pets than it is to be surrounded by images. The particular texture of the subject in a painting is so...carnal. The painting's viewer can reach into the painting and touch and feel, not just see. Hanging up a portrait of a gold necklace painted with gold leaf is almost as good as having the necklace itself. </p>

<blockquote> “For Renaissance artists, painting was perhaps an instrument of knowledge but it was also an instrument of possession..."</blockquote>

<figure class='left-half'><img src='../assets/black2.png'><figcaption><code>black2.png</code> is the title of this work</figcaption></figure> <figure class='right-half'><img src='../assets/pinkys.png'><figcaption><code>pinkys.png</code> is the title of this piece</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p> Cameras show that the notion of time passing is part of the experience of the visual. In paintings, the subject is frozen in time. </p>

<p> Images are for consuming: </p>

<blockquote>
"As we make images and consume them, we need more."
</blockquote>

and the delightful element about consuming images that are paintings/painting-like is the lack of mortality in the subject. Photographs show the subject at a certain point in time, pointing to life and death, but paintings are not so somber.


<p> Given that I feel so embarrassed/stressed about my Taeyong obssession, I wonder if Tarkovsky is talking about me when he discusses artists in <strong> Sculpting in Time</strong>:

<blockquote>“True artistic inspiration is always a torment for the artist, almost to the point of endangering his life. Its realisation is tantamount to a physical feat."</blockquote>
