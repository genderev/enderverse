<h1>Healing at East River Park</h1>
<center> How do we heal from the destruction of the park? </center>

<h2> What is happening </h2>
<p>
New York City is cutting down trees in East River Park. I consider this environmental racism. Some parks in NYC have conservancies paid for by wealthy NYC residents that make sure trees in the park do not get cut down.
<br><br>
East River Park is located across from a public housing complex whose residents cannot pay the city to stop cutting down trees in East River Park. <br><br>

I found out about this group through Twitter. On the first day I traveled to the park, Sara gave me gloves for my cold hands. Ana gave me a coat and a MetroCard. It is hard to explain how overwhelmed I was that these people - practically strangers - gave me the clothes off their back and the money from their wallet to care for me. <br><br>

What matters is that the destruction of the park, even if I didn't know about it last year, brought me here, to tell you everything.
</p>
<h2> How we heal </h2>
<p>
In the face of this ruthless destruction of East River Park by the city, how do we continue? How do we heal ourselves and the Earth?
  <br><br>
We seek justice for the waters, for the four-legged and winged beings whose habitats have been taken.   <br><br>
We seek justice not just for ourselves, but for the whole of Creation.
<br><br>
We are suffering. We feel hopeless and powerless.
  <br><br>
Our suffering is connected with the suffering of other beings. When we work to reduce the suffering of others, we ourselves are the first to benefit.   <br><br>
When we give ourselves compassion, right away we suffer less. Knowing how to suffer less, we also learn how to produce happiness.   <br><br>
Joy is a measure of freedom. Joy reminds us that even in the dark, we are alive.   <br><br>
We dance for the renewal of the world, in the return for the privilege of breathing. We choose joy over despair because the Earth gives us joy daily and we return this joy, as a gift.   <br><br>
We always have the power to co-create the world. We restore the land, the land restores us.   <br><br>
To plant trees is an act of faith. In restoring the land, we restore ourselves.   <br><br>
As we work to heal the Earth, we are healed. We send a gift to the future that grows more beautiful with time.   <br><br>
Our co-creation is an ongoing process.   <br><br>
Whether we want to or not, we are traveling in a spiral, creating something new from what is gone.
