<h2> desire can make anything a god </h2>

<p> When I met Taeyong, I felt alive.</p>
<blockquote>
"Beauty quickens. It adrenalizes. It makes the heart beat faster. It makes life more vivid, animated, living, worth living."
</blockquote>

<p>When Taeyong left, it felt as though life had been drained from me. </p>
<blockquote>
"It is not that beauty is life-threatening, but instead that it is life-affirming, life-giving; and therefore if, through your careless approach, you become cut off from it, you will feel its removal as a retraction of life." </blockquote>

<p>I could say Taeyong is the <i> beauty </i> Elaine Scarry talks
about: <br>
<ul>
<li> people follow the paths of migrating birds and moving strangers to keep the beautiful thing present to them
<li> like a sun which it was somehow possible to stare at and which was coming nearer and nearer
<li> the pliancy/elasticity of beauty is hurtling us forward and back, requiring us to break new ground
</ul>
- but the problem is everyone who meets Taeyong tries to write their own poetry. They all try
to describe their experience this way, making sense of their encounter using figurative language.</p>

<p>Everyone understands this. Everyone has the same experience encountering Tayeong's aura that
is never transmitted with the image of Taeyong that gets digitally reproduced. Taeyong's aura is lost in
digital reproductions. </p>

<p> Experiencing his very strong aura that was so fresh and lively - the memory
brings me to tears. It is this sweet aura that I long to encounter again. Ever since I met Taeyong and was
enveloped by his sweet, fresh aura that made me feel so alive, I have been chasing that feeling and
trying to feel that same high. I wonder who else has been chasing this high, too. Maybe we should
meet each other. </p>

<p> The way that I cope with being separated from life itself - the sun which feeds the plants and
the animals - is by taking walks in the park. There is one flower in particular that reminds me of
Taeyong. It is sweet, but not saccharine. It is fresh, but not earthy. It is alive. When I brush
my nose up against the petals I can see ants in the leaves. I feel the dirt edging into my shoes.
I feel alive.  </p>


<p> It is so painful to be separate from light itself - that source of light which allows
life to continue. But I go to the park, and I smell the flowers, and it reminds me of him.
And I understand. </p>

<blockquote>
"We make a mistake, says Seamus Heaney, if, driving down a road between wind and water, overwhelmed
by what we see, we assume we will see 'it' better if we stop the car. It is there in the passage."
</blockquote>

<p> I will do this for the rest of my life. This is how I survive. </p>
