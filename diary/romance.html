<p> adrienne maree brown says you can have no needs and have autonomy,
  dignity, and control over your life, <em>or</em> you can admit you need care and lose everything.
  We have survived by needing absolutely nothing. </p>

  "Falling in love is like a mediation where every tiny detail and feeling merges into the now...
  allowing yourself to be immersed in a shared aliveness"

<p> Uncertainty makes us feel alive. It makes us lean into the question of our existence. </p>

"I was once foolish enough to think knowledge would clarify...
the rules, like streets, can only take you to known places."

<p>bell hooks said that when we commit to true love, we commit to being changed. There is no change that does not come without a sense of loss. </p>

my nose up against the petals I can see ants in the leaves. I feel the dirt edging into my shoes.
I feel alive.</a></p>
